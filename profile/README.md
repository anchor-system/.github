# anchor-system

The anchor system is an alternate way of thinking of notes and chords with respect to regular music. 

It takes the idea of roman numerals and diatonic chords and takes it to the next level by assigning each note an index based on some root note.

# learning

* [standard memorizer](https://github.com/anchor-system/standard-memorizer) - a program which helps you memorize sequences of chords in the anchor system

# programs

Over time I have built up a few programs which pair nicely with this system including virtual instruments that create midi notes:

* [keyboard](https://github.com/anchor-system/keyboard) - the original virtual keyboard design in python (no longer actively maintained, but still works!)
* [c-keyboard](https://github.com/anchor-system/keyboard) - a more lightweight alternative to the original keyboard, written in c++ for maximal speed.
* [wooboard](https://github.com/anchor-system/wooboard) - a velocity sensitive keyboard for the wooting 60 keyboard, also written in c++. (Note this only works if you have a wooting 60!)
